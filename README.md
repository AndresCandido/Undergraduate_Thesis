In this thesis, we aimed to increase our understanding of how eQTLs can be detected at the single-cell level using scRNA-seq data and of how eQTL analysis tools such as eQTLsingle can accomplish doing so, as well as to address the inherent limitations of only utilizing scRNA-seq for detecting eQTLs and to find solutions to these limitations by using relevant literature
