# Undergraduate_Thesis
In this thesis, we aimed to increase our understanding of how eQTLs can be detected at the single-cell level using scRNA-seq data and of how eQTLsingle, an eQTL analysis tool, can accomplish doing so.
We also aimed to address eQTLsingle's inherent limitations due to only utilizing scRNA-seq for detecting eQTLs and to propose solutions to these limitations by using relevant literature.
